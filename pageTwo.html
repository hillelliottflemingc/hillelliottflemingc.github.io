	Dear Hiring Committee,
	<br></br>
	I am very interested in this GIS position. I have 2-3 years of professional experience in the GIS field and have completed my undergraduate degree from Concordia University, in Human Environment and Geospatial Technologies. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I maintained a high GPA and made the Deanâ€™s Honours List for three years in a row. I am currently continuing my education with the post-graduate GIS Applications Specialist program through Fleming College. 
	<br></br>
	I am a previous Canadian National Team athlete in Modern Pentathlon and have competed in many international competitions, World Cups and the 2015 Pan-American Games! Over the course of my athletic career, I have developed a very strong work ethic and can embrace demanding work. I am very open-minded, patient, and punctual. Throughout my university and athletic career, I have developed good interpersonal skills, where communication, working with others and problem solving have become my key strengths. I am bilingual in English and French and have basic knowledge of German and Spanish. My travels to many countries around the world through sport and personal endeavours have granted me the opportunity to see the environmental impacts of global warming, the devastation caused by governmental unrest, natural disasters and the inequality around the world. By learning French at a young age and having some German and Spanish language exposure, I have had the opportunity to volunteer in environmental cleanup projects in some of the countries in which I travelled. I feel grateful for the opportunities my language skills and sports experiences have given me and I want to continue to give back and help others.
	<br></br>
	In addition to my studies at Concordia University and my athletic career, I have worked and volunteered in a variety of fields. Presently, I am working as a GIS Technician for the Township of Georgian Bluffs in Ontario. My responsibilities include working autonomously to update and create layers, domains and databases with information regarding roads, trails, water services, cemeteries, different types of infrastructure and other relevant information for city planning and civilian use. This position has given me valuable working experience in the GIS field and I have learned a lot from those at the township as well as from working with contracted consultants. Over the past two years, I have additionally been a GIS volunteer for the Canadian Red Cross where we digitize and update open street maps before and after disasters, as well as for marginalized communities who do not presently have updated maps of their communities. Other volunteer experience throughout the years have included being a full time host family for the Mira Foundation and part-time at a local zero-waste shop. I also have experience working for the city of Montreal as a water quality technician, an English tutour for children in China, a landscaper, and a waitress. I am eager to have the opportunity to learn more and apply the skills and knowledge I have acquired over the years to something I am passionate about, such as working with your company.
	<br></br>
	Sincerely,
	<br></br>
	Hillary Elliott
